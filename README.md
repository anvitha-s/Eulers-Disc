## Euler's Disc
MATLAB simulation of the motion of an Euler's Disc
# General
The simulations are performed on MATLAB by implementing dissipation moments and forces and formulating the equations of motion by taking suitable assumtions(pure rolling), which are then implemented as a state space model similar to the one used in the animation of the ideal thin Rolling disc on [Rotations](http://rotations.berkeley.edu/the-rolling-disk/)

#Instructions for running the simulation
1. Store all the three Matlab files in the same folder.
2. Run the derive_eom.m file once.
3. Ensure this creates a rolling_disc_ODEs.mat file in this folder.
4. Run the emo.m file, this should display graphs and an animation which starts on the enter keystroke.
